# Kommadek

Kommadek is a GUI application based in Qt/C++ to view and edit CSV files.

We have chosen C++ as the primary programming language for this project because we have a decent knowledge of C++ and I have prior work experience in Qt. Also, the documentation for Qt is easily the best among all the GUI frameworks available in C++.
